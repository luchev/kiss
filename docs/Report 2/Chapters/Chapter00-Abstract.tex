Version 1 of this project proposed a storage system based on Kademlia, which used verification to ensure the system's integrity.
In this project, we will propose a system that is resilient to adversary attacks aimed at deleting or altering data.
Like many others, the system implements key-value storage (also known as distributed hash tables).
A verification mechanism is introduced to improve the resilience of the network, which is absent in other similar systems.
The system was divided into Keeper (storage) and Verifier (maintaining integrity) nodes.

Version 1 was a proof of concept focusing on introducing the main ideas, whilst in this second iteration we are refining them and building on top.
The main changes are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Decentralizing the Verifier node and its responsibilities
    \item Building the Verifier logic on top of the Kademlia network
    \item Unifying the Keeper and Verifier nodes into a single logical node
    \item Joining the network is gated by a crypto puzzle
    \item Verification is more efficient thanks to Proof of Retrievability
\end{enumerate}
