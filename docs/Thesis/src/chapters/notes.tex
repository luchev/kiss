Introduction
% - pitch the idea
% - how can we test/evaluate
% - convince the reader that this solves problems in other systems
% - reader must be able to understand the paper from reading the intro and conclusion
% - evaluate how does it compare to other systems
% - use cases (storage for storage, no centralized point of failure, corporations bad, not want to pay, check filecoin)
% - why not use centralized system
% - state the hypothesis and how it will be investigated + tested
% - talk about the evaluation - what problem it solves and how it will be tested/evaluated
