\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Decentralized network} --- A network where no single entity has control over the network. While there are no minimum requirements for a network to be decentralized, when we talk about a decentralized network we will expect no single entity to have control of the majority of the nodes and for the network to have at least 10 nodes.
    \item \textbf{Keeper} --- A node, which stores files/data and provides them when requested.
    \item \textbf{Verifier} --- A node which performs audits on the files in the network in order to ensure their integrity.
    \item \textbf{PoR} --- Proof of Retrievability. A scheme that allows a client to check if a peer stores the data it claims to store efficiently using cryptography.
